issues
----
- speed of reading from disk
  -> read more data at once - 60 frames buffered before and after

- speed of creating mesh
  -> cubic too costly?

options
----
1. read all data at start
  - all data becomes too much
2. keep buffered data around current point, read from large files
  - reading might not be fast enough
